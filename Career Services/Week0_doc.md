## What are you hoping to get out of career services?

Ultimately, I hope to get hired at a major tech company (Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, etc.), but in the meantime, I'd like to have a new set of job search materials suitable for applying to these kinds of companies. I come from a different industry, and, honestly, it's been a while since I needed a literal resume for my job search. I was freelance and found work almost exclusively through introductions, so insight into how to prepare a resume and a portfolio for the software industry would be very valuable to me.

## What is your dream job?

I don't know. I got into software development to influence the future of audio tools, and I know I'd be happy working on those kinds of products. That said, I have very little experience as a professional software developer. It's hard for me to rule anything out, or come up with definitive answers.

There are just too many fascinating topics to explore. Extended reality, the future of digital learning, game design... I've been facing more than a little decision paralysis when it comes to defining my future goals.

## What companies are you interested in, if any?

Google, first and foremost. I have friends and family that have worked there and that have hyped up the environment and company culture. It seems like a great place to work. Beyond that, any of the other major tech companies. I'm more inclined to work at a major company than a startup or small company at this point. Given the choice, I'd rather be a small fish in a big pond than the opposite. At least, for now.

## What are job titles that you are interested in applying to after the program?

(Junior) Software Dev, ML Dev, Full-Stack Engineer.

## What concerns do you have about your job search?

I have very little to show on my resume that matches the work I want to be doing. My portfolio is no longer current. (Last major project was from over a year ago, and they are all learning projects. No full products.) Also, I don't know how to write a resume for a developer job.

## Are you looking for a junior, mid-level or senior level position?

Junior. Would be willing to reach for a mid level job in the right circumstances.

## Is there a type of company that you would like to target?

Major tech companies with a global presence. The kind of place where I could reasonably expect to work for 5-10 years, without giving up the possibility of moving to another city/state/country/hemisphere.

## Is there anything else that you think career services should know about your job search?

All the things I've said and the preferences I've stated are entirely flexible. I'm at an inflection point in my life, and am willing to pursue any path that seems promising.
